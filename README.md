# EEG-Data-Processing-IED-Classification-SHAP-Feature-Importance-Analysis
This repository provides an EEG data processing pipeline for IED classification. It includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and training multiple classifiers (e.g., CatBoost, XGBoost, SVM). SHAP analysis is used to interpret feature and channel importance, enabling transparent and reproducible EEG analysis.
